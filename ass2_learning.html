                            <p>
                                In our first semester, we were introduced to the foundational concepts of computer science. SECI1013 (Discrete Structure) provided the mathematical basis with set theory, logic, and graph theory, which built a foundation for logical thinking and problem-solving in programming. SECJ1013 (Programming Technique I) marked our first experience with C++, where we learned basic programming constructs. SECR1013 (Digital Logic) demystified the inner workings of computers through digital circuits. SECP1513 (Technology & Information System) gave us a broad overview of IT systems, and ULRS1012 (Value and Identity) encouraged ethical self-reflection. Our key takeaway was building a strong foundation in both programming and theory.

                            <p>
                                Semester two deepened our technical skills. SECI1113 (Computational Mathematics) applied math to computing, while SECI1143 (Probability & Statistical Data Analysis) introduced statistical thinking. SECJ1023 (Programming Technique II) advanced our C++ skills with object-oriented programming. SECR2033 (Computer Organisation and Architecture) explored computer hardware in detail. SECD2613 (System Analysis and Design) taught us how to plan software projects. UHMS1182 (Appreciation of Ethics and Civilizations) broadened our ethical understanding, and UHLM1012 (Malaysia Language for Communication) (for international students) improved our language skills. We focused on transitioning from procedural to object-oriented programming and understanding system design principles.

                            <p>
                                Year two began with more specialized courses. SECD2523 (Database) taught us SQL and database design. SECJ2203 (Software Engineering) provided a framework for software development methodologies. SECJ2013 (Data Structure and Algorithm) challenged us with efficient data organization and problem-solving. SECR2213 (Network Communications) explained network fundamentals, and SECV2113 (Human Computer Interaction) emphasized user-centric design. UKQF2xx2 (Service Learning & Community Engagement Courses) allowed us to apply our knowledge in a community setting. We concentrated on database management, software development processes, and algorithmic thinking.

                                In our second semester of Year 2, we further specialized our computer science knowledge. SECJ3203 (Theory of Computer Science) introduced us to the theoretical foundations of computation. SECV2223 (Web Programming) provided hands-on experience in developing web applications. SECR2043 (Operating Systems) explored the core functions and management of operating systems. SECJ2154 (Object Oriented Programming) deepened our understanding of OOP principles. UHLB2122 (Professional Communication Skills 1) focused on enhancing our communication abilities in a professional context. UHIS1022 (Philosophy and Current Issues) (for Malaysian students) encouraged critical thinking about contemporary issues. Additionally, we chose one elective course: SECJ2253 (Requirements Engineering & Software Modelling) or SECJ2363 (Software Project Management), allowing for specialization in either software development processes or project management.
